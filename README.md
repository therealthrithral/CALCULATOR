This is just a simple little program I wrote to practice switch case.  

Program is self explanatory.  It is a simple calculator that takes your operation input, and 2 number inputs and performs that operation on them.  After it performs the operation, it prints the full operation along with the result and terminates the program

TODO:
- Add floating point division
- Add functionality for more than one input
- Add functionality for floating point math
- Add functionality for remainder math
- Add functionality for FizzBuzz
